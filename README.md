# Connect_Four_Bot

This is a text-based version of the game Connect Four. The player will be  matched against an AI. The game randomly decides who goes first, the player and the AI will then play the game out, until either side wins, or the game ends in a tie. After that the player's new score will be calculated, and the player will be asked to choose to play again or to leave. If the player chooses to leave, the game will end.
